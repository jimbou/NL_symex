You are a C/KLEE expert. The verifier flagged an issue in the stub assumptions:

--- Original Code ---
#include <stdio.h>
  // optional, or just define above
#include "../bonus_calculator.h"  
int compute(int x) {
    int result = x * 2;

    
    // This part calculates a bonus based on some complex criteria.
    int bonus = calculate_bonus(x);
    result += bonus;
    

    return result;
}
--- End Original ---

--- Transformed Code ---
#include <klee/klee.h>

// Stub implementation for calculate_bonus
// Models that bonus is between 0-100 when x > 0, otherwise 0
int calculate_bonus(int x) {
    int bonus;
    klee_make_symbolic(&bonus, sizeof(bonus), "bonus");
    if (x > 0) {
        klee_assume(bonus >= 0 && bonus <= 100);
    } else {
        klee_assume(bonus == 0);
    }
    return bonus;
}

int compute(int x) {
    int result = x * 2;

    // This part calculates a bonus based on some complex criteria.
    int bonus = calculate_bonus(x);
    result += bonus;

    return result;
}

--- Verifier Feedback ---
The transformation is not correct. Please try to create a model of the bonus function
--- End Feedback ---

**Task:**  
See if the feedback is correct and if yes then use the feedback to produce a **corrected transformed version** of the C code.  
- Keep everything else KLEE‐friendly (symbolic declarations, assumptions, etc.).  
- Ensure it still compiles under a standard C toolchain + KLEE.
Rewrite the problematic part(s) of the code using the feedback and return the transformed version that is compilable and runnable in klee in the following format:

Corrected Code Start
```c
<corrected C code here>
````

Corrected Code End
