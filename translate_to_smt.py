PROMPT_SMT_FULL = """
You are helping translate part of a C function into SMT-LIBv2 format for symbolic execution.

The function contains a region marked by `assume_NL_start;` and `assume_NL_stop;`. This region is missing and will be replaced by constraints over input/output variables.

Function context:


{c_function}



Missing block (could be in NAtural language, code or a mix):


{NL_code}

Precondition path constraints (path constraints before this block):


{precondition}


Postcondition path constraints: (path constraints before this block):
{postcondition}
 

* Translate the NL block to SMT constraints consistent with the inputs/outputs described.
* Reuse variable names or declare them if needed.
* Use logic appropriate for **KLEE** (e.g., bitvectors and arrays).
* Focus on modeling **data flow and logic** from the NL block only â€” do not re-express pre/post constraints.

Wrap your output strictly between:

SMT\_START <your SMT2 code>
SMT\_END
