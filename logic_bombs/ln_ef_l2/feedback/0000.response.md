Reasoning:
- The original code checks if 1.94 < log(symvar) < 1.95, which is only true for symvar such that exp(1.94) < symvar < exp(1.95), i.e., symvar == 7 (since symvar is an integer and exp(1.94) ≈ 6.96, exp(1.95) ≈ 7.03).
- The transformed code models this by assigning d = 1.945 only if symvar == 7, else d = 0.0, and adds klee_assume(symvar > 0) to ensure log's domain is respected.
- The transformation preserves all observable behavior: both versions will only take the "bomb" branch if symvar == 7, and otherwise take the normal branch.
- No missing constraints or symbolic execution issues: klee_assume is present for domain, and log is stubbed in a way that is suitable for KLEE.
