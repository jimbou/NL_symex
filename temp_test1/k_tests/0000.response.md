```python
def remap_testcase(inputs: dict[str, list[int]]) -> dict[str, list[int]]:
    """
    Remap symbolic input bytes from the transformed code back to original code.

    For this problem:
      - The transformed code expects s[0] == 55 ('7') to trigger the bomb path.
      - In original code, s[0] is passed through: int symvar = s[0] - 48; d = log(symvar);
        The bomb triggers when 2 < d < 3, i.e., when symvar in (exp(2), exp(3)), i.e. (7.389, 20.085).
        So, symvar in [8, 20] (since symvar is int > 0).
        Thus, s[0] in [56, 68] (since s[0] = symvar + 48).

    The transformed code only sets s[0] = 55 ('7'), which is symvar=7 (log(7) ~ 1.95, not in (2,3)).
    But for bomb path, original code requires s[0] in 56..68.

    So: For any input, if s[0] == 55 ('7'), remap it to s[0] = 56 ('8').
         For other values, leave unchanged.

    Only s[0] is relevant; s[1:4] can be left as is, s[4] must be '\0'.
