Reasoning:
- The transformed code replaces the original `calculate_bonus` function with a KLEE-friendly stub that models the bonus behavior symbolically.
- The stub correctly assumes that the bonus is between 0 and 100 when `x > 0`, and 0 otherwise, which matches the likely intent of the original code (though this is an assumption, as the original implementation is not provided).
- The core logic of `compute` remains unchanged, preserving behavioral equivalence.
- No unbounded loops or removed branches are introduced, and the KLEE assumptions are appropriately placed.
