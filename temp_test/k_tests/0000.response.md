NO_TRANSLATION_NEEDED

**Justification:**

- In both the original and transformed code, the symbolic input is the array `s` of 5 bytes, with `s[4] == '\0'` enforced.
- The key logic is:  
  - `symvar = s[0] - 48`  
  - In the transformed code, `symvar == 7` triggers the "bomb", i.e., sets `d = 2.5` (which is in (2,3)).  
  - In the original code, `d = log(symvar)`, and the "bomb" triggers if `2 < d < 3` ⇒ `e^2 < symvar < e^3` ⇒ `7 < symvar < 20.08...` (i.e., `symvar` in {8,9,10,...,20}).
- However, in the **transformed code**, only `symvar == 7` triggers the bomb, so the transformation is more restrictive than the original.
- The provided test case is `s = b'7\xff\xff\xff\x00'`, i.e., `s[0] = 0x37 = 55`, so `symvar = 55 - 48 = 7`, which is the *only* value that triggers the bomb in the transformed code.
- In the original code, `symvar = 7` gives `log(7) ≈ 1.9459`, which is **not** in (2,3), so the bomb would **not** trigger for this input.
- Therefore, **the test case does NOT exercise the same path in the original code**; in fact, the set of inputs for the bomb in the original code is different from the transformed code.

**Conclusion:**  
**Translation IS needed** because the transformed code only triggers the bomb for `symvar == 7`, but in the original code, the bomb triggers for `symvar` in {8,9,...,20}. To map a test case that triggers the bomb in the transformed code to one that triggers the bomb in the original code, we must select a value of `s[0]` such that `symvar` is in {8,9,...,20}. The closest analog is to set `s[0] = 56` (for `symvar = 8`).

Below is a Python function that remaps the test case accordingly:

```python
def remap_testcase(inputs: dict[str, list[int]]) -> dict[str, list[int]]:
    # Copy the input to avoid modifying the original
    out = {k: v[:] for k, v in inputs.items()}
    # s[0]: originally 55 ('7'), which makes symvar == 7
    # For original code, need symvar in 8..20, use 8 (s[0] = 56, '8')
    if 's' in out and len(out['s']) >= 5:
        out['s'][0] = 56  # ord('8')
        out['s'][4] = 0   # Ensure null-termination
    return out
```
**Explanation:**  
- Sets `s[0] = 56` (`'8'`), so `symvar = 8`, which is in the bomb-triggering range for the original code.
- Keeps the rest of the bytes unchanged except for `s[4]` (enforces null-termination).
