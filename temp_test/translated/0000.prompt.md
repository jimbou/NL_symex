You are a symbolic execution assistant.

The user is working with KLEE, a symbolic execution engine for C code. 
They want to explore more execution paths, but their code contains constructs 
that are difficult for symbolic execution tools to analyze (e.g., indirect memory, 
system calls, external functions, loops, etc.).

You are given:
1. The original C code that contains symbolic execution challenges.
2. A list of relevant transformation strategies to guide rewriting.

Your task is:
- Identify the part(s) of the original code that fall under the listed categories.
- Rewrite those parts into code that is **equivalent in behavior**, but **better suited for symbolic execution** with tools like KLEE.
- Ensure the final code is **compilable** and that functionality (i.e., return values, branching logic, and I/O behavior) is preserved.
- Use constructs like `klee_make_symbolic`, `klee_assume`, and optionally `klee_assert` where appropriate.

Only rewrite the minimal necessary fragment(s) — not the whole program if it’s not needed. Be precise and KLEE-compatible.

### Original C Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
  // optional, or just define above
#include "../bonus_calculator.h"  
int compute(int x) {
    int result = x * 2;

    assume_NL_start;
    // This part calculates a bonus based on some complex criteria.
    int bonus = calculate_bonus(x);
    result += bonus;
    assume_NL_stop;

    return result;
}

### Relevant Transformation Strategies


Category: External function calls

## The problem
Programs often rely on external library functions (like `sin`, `atoi`, `sqrt`) 
for computations. Since these functions are dynamically linked or opaque to the 
symbolic engine, their internal control flows and constraints are invisible. 
If these outputs are used in later conditions, symbolic execution may miss 
critical paths.

## How to fix it
Rewrite the code to:
- Replace external function calls with explicit approximations, either via 
piecewise functions, look-up tables, or symbolic variables with carefully 
chosen assumptions. This ensures the symbolic execution engine can still 
reason about possible outputs and explore all relevant branches.

## Example

### Original code
int logic_bomb(char* symvar) {
    int i = symvar[0] - 48;
    float v = sin(i * PI / 30);
    if(v > 0.5){
        return BOMB_ENDING;
    }
    return NORMAL_ENDING;
}

### Transformed code
#include <klee/klee.h>

int logic_bomb() {
    int i;
    klee_make_symbolic(&i, sizeof(i), "i");
    klee_assume(i >= 0 && i <= 30);

    float v;
    // Piecewise approximation of sin
    if (i < 5)
        v = 0.1;
    else if (i < 10)
        v = 0.3;
    else if (i < 15)
        v = 0.6;
    else
        v = 0.9;

    if(v > 0.5){
        return BOMB_ENDING;
    }
    return NORMAL_ENDING;
}



## Now rewrite the problematic part(s) of the code and return the transformed version in the follwoing format:
### Transformed C Code:
Start_of_transformed_code
```c
TRANSFORMED_CODE
```
End_of_transformed_code
