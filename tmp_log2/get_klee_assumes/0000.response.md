Reasoning:
The target line `return 1;` at line 16 is reached only if the condition in line 15 `if(2 < d && d < 4)` evaluates to true. The variable `d` is used in this condition and is declared and assigned after `assume_NL_start();` and before `assume_NL_stop();` as `double d = log(symvar);` (line 13). The value of `d` is computed from `symvar`, which is assigned at line 11 as `int symvar = s[0] - 48;`, but this assignment occurs before `assume_NL_start();`, so `symvar` does not qualify as "critical" per the rules. Only `d` qualifies.
