You are a C program analysis assistant.

You are given the full C source code of a function and a **specific line** in the code that we want to ensure is **covered during testing**.

---

## Your Task:

Add a series of **printf statements** to print the values of variables that are **critical to reaching the specified line**.

Be **conservative and precise**. A variable is considered **critical** if it satisfies all of the following:
1. it is declared or written in the part between `assume_NL_start();` and `assume_NL_stop();`
1. After the `assume_NL_stop();` it **influences the control flow that leads to the specified line**, meaning it is:
   - used in an `if`, `while`, `for`, or `switch` condition that guards the target line
   - used in a `return` whose value is then used in a condition influencing the line
   - used as an argument to a function whose return influences a branch that leads to the target line

2. It must be **read** before reaching the target line (not just written to).

3. Prefer **direct dependencies**, but include **indirect ones** only if they are clearly linked to the control flow reaching the line.

---

## Instrumentation Format

1. Print the variables in the format:

```c
printf("Variable VAR_NAME = FORMAT_SPECIFIER of type TYPE
", VAR_NAME);
````

For example:

```c
printf("Variable a = %d of type int
", a);
printf("Variable x = %f of type float
", x);
```

2. If a variable is of type `float` or `double`, **try to cast or treat it as `int` if doing so allows the program to compile and behave as expected**.

3. Do **not** print variables that are:
   * are not written or read in the  part of the code between `assume_NL_start();` and `assume_NL_stop();`
   * written but never read before the target line
   * unrelated to the control flow leading to the line
   * we care about the conrol flow after `assume_NL_stop();`, so do not print variables that are only used before it



## Inputs:

You are given:

* The **full C source code** of a function
* The **line number** of the line we want to ensure is covered (1-based indexing)
* The **exact string** of the target line (to help you locate it)

Use this information to reason about which variables affect control flow leading to that line.

---

## Output Format

* First explain your reasoning clearly and briefly.
* Then write the line: `PRINT STATEMENTS START NOW`
* Then output the `printf` lines, one per line, exactly as they would appear in the code. Do **not** include any extra text or markdown.

---

## Example Output

Reasoning:
The line `if (x > 3)` is guarded by `if (x > 3)` and depends on `x`.

PRINT STATEMENTS START NOW
printf("Variable x = %d of type int
", x);

## Code to Analyze:

```c
1: #include <klee/klee.h>
2: 
3: /*
4: TOY:
5: */
6: #include <string.h> 
7: #include <math.h>
8: 
9: // {"s":{"length": 4}}
10: int logic_bomb(char* s) {
11:     int symvar = s[0] - 48;
12:     // assume_NL_start();
13:     double d = log(symvar); 
14:     // assume_NL_stop();
15:     if(2 < d && d < 4){
16:         return 1;
17:     }else{
18:         return 0;
19:     }
20: }
21: 
22: int main() {
23:     char s[4];
24:     klee_make_symbolic(s, sizeof(s), "s");
25:     // Ensure s is printable (optional) and s[0] >= '0'
26:     klee_assume(s[0] >= 0);
27:     logic_bomb(s);
28:     return 0;
29: }
```

## Line to Cover:

Line 16:
return 1;
