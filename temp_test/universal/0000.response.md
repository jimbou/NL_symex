Since the problematic part involves an external function `calculate_bonus()` whose implementation isn't shown, I'll provide a stub implementation that models its behavior symbolically. This preserves functionality while making it KLEE-friendly.

### Transformed C Code:
Start_of_transformed_code
```c
#include <klee/klee.h>

// Stub implementation for calculate_bonus
// Models that bonus is between 0-100 when x > 0, otherwise 0
int calculate_bonus(int x) {
    int bonus;
    klee_make_symbolic(&bonus, sizeof(bonus), "bonus");
    if (x > 0) {
        klee_assume(bonus >= 0 && bonus <= 100);
    } else {
        klee_assume(bonus == 0);
    }
    return bonus;
}

int compute(int x) {
    int result = x * 2;

    // This part calculates a bonus based on some complex criteria.
    int bonus = calculate_bonus(x);
    result += bonus;

    return result;
}
```
End_of_transformed_code

Key transformations:
1. Added KLEE header
2. Created a stub for `calculate_bonus()` that:
   - Makes the bonus value symbolic
   - Uses `klee_assume` to constrain possible values based on input
   - Models a simple but realistic behavior (positive x gets 0-100 bonus)
3. Preserved the original computation logic

This version:
- Compiles under standard C + KLEE
- Maintains functionality for the constrained input space
- Allows symbolic exploration of all possible bonus values within the assumed bounds
- Will work for both concrete and symbolic execution
