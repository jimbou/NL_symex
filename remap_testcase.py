    Remap the test case for the original code.

    In the transformed code:
        int symvar = s[0] - 48;
        int d = symvar;
        if (2 < d && d < 4)

    In the original code:
        int symvar = s[0] - 48;
        double d = log(symvar);
        if (2 < d && d < 4)

    So, in the transformed code, d is symvar, and in the original, d is log(symvar).
    For the transformed code to take the same path, symvar must be 3 (since 2 < d < 4: d==3).

    For the original code, we need to find symvar such that log(symvar) in (2,4).
    That is, symvar in (exp(2), exp(4)) ≈ (7.389, 54.598). Since symvar = s[0] - 48 and must be integer,
    s[0] = symvar + 48, and symvar in [8,54] (since s[0] must be integer and >=0).

    But the transformed test case gives us s[0] such that symvar == 3 (i.e., s[0] == 51).
    But for the original code, to hit the branch, s[0] must be in [56,102] (i.e., symvar in [8,54]).

    So, to remap: If the test case sets s[0] to X, we must set s[0] in the original to round(exp(X)) + 48.

    However, in the transformed code, d = symvar, so the constraint is 2 < symvar < 4, so symvar==3.
    Therefore, the test case will have s[0] == 51 (since 51-48==3).

    To get the original input that will result in log(symvar) == 3, we invert:
        log(symvar) == 3  => symvar = exp(3) ≈ 20.0855
        s[0] = int(round(20.0855)) + 48 = 20 + 48 = 68

    So, for each test case where s[0] == X, we want s[0]_orig = int(round(math.exp(X))) + 48

    However, the transformed test case only triggers for s[0] == 51 (symvar==3). So, for that, we set s[0]_orig = 68.

    Generalizing: For each test case, for s[0], set s[0]_orig = int(round(math.exp(s[0] - 48))) + 48

    But in the transformed code, the bytes for 's' are just 4 bytes. So we only need to update s[0].

    The rest of the bytes remain unchanged.
