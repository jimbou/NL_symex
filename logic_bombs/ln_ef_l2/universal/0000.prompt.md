You’re a C/KLEE expert. Real‐world C often trips symbolic executors because of:

  • Hidden/implicit inputs: getpid(), getenv(), rand(), file reads, syscalls  
  • Covert flows: writing to disk, shell calls, IPC  
  • Buffer overflows: unchecked strcpy/memcpy  
  • Indirect memory: symbolic indices, pointers, func‐pointer jumps  
  • External ops: math libs (sin, sqrt), crypto (SHA1, AES), inline‐asm  
  • Unbounded loops: while/for with symbolic bounds  
  • Concurrency/interrupts: threads, signals, IRQs  
  • OS deps: stat(), open(), read(), execve()  
  • Pointer aliasing: multiple names for same address  
  • Floating/overflow: float rounding, integer wraparound  

And the **usual remedies** in KLEE‐friendly code:

  ‣ Declare inputs symbolic via `klee_make_symbolic` + constrain with `klee_assume`  
  ‣ Eliminate file/shell/IPC hand‐offs—keep data in memory  
  ‣ Add `klee_assert` to expose buffer overflows  
  ‣ Expand symbolic indices into `if`/`switch` on each case  
  ‣ Stub out externals or library functions (sin, SHA1, atoi, etc.) by writing simple C functions  
    (or comment‐annotated skeletons) that model their effects  
  ‣ Unroll/bound loops, then `klee_assume(loop_count <= N)`  
  ‣ Turn function‐pointer calls and indirect jumps into explicit branches  
  ‣ Model syscalls/signals as symbolic flags or return codes  
  ‣ Replace inline‐asm with fresh symbolic variables

**Now**:  
1. Here’s your original C snippet:
```

/*
TOY:
*/
#include <string.h> 
#include <math.h>
#include "utils.h"
#include "a_tester.h"



// {"s":{"length": 4}}
int logic_bomb(char* s) {
    
    int symvar = s[0] - 48;
    double d = log(symvar);
     
    if(1.94 < d && d < 1.95){
        return BOMB_ENDING;
    }else{
        return NORMAL_ENDING;
    }
}

```

and more specifically here is the part of the code you need to rewrite:
```
int symvar = s[0] - 48;
    double d = log(symvar);
```

2. **Rewrite only the problematic parts** using the above techniques so that:
   - Functionality (outputs, branches) is preserved.  
   - It compiles under standard C + KLEE.  
   - If full generality is impossible, restrict via `klee_assume` so that you can return a functionally equivalent version at least for a subset of inputs.

3. For any external library or crypto call, **provide a stub implementation**—either real code or a comment block with function signature and intended behavior.

## Now rewrite the problematic part(s) of the code and return the transformed version that is compilable and runnable in klee in the following format:
### Transformed C Code:
Start_of_transformed_code
```c
TRANSFORMED_CODE
```
End_of_transformed_code
