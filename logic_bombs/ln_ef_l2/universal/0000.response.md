 * Stub for log() function.
 * Since log() is monotonic for positive x, we can model it with 
 * a symbolic double constrained to match log(symvar) in the branch of interest.
 * Alternatively, for the specific branch, we can solve for symvar:
 *    1.94 < log(symvar) < 1.95  =>  exp(1.94) < symvar < exp(1.95)
 *    exp(1.94) ≈ 6.96, exp(1.95) ≈ 7.03, so symvar == 7
 * So, for the branch to be taken, symvar must be 7.
 * We replace log(symvar) with a branch on symvar.
