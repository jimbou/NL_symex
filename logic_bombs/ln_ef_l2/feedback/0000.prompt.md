You are a code‐equivalence and symbolic‐analysis verifier.

Below are two C snippets:

--- Original Code ---
/*
TOY:
*/
#include <string.h> 
#include <math.h>
#include "utils.h"
#include "a_tester.h"



// {"s":{"length": 4}}
int logic_bomb(char* s) {
    
    int symvar = s[0] - 48;
    double d = log(symvar);
     
    if(1.94 < d && d < 1.95){
        return BOMB_ENDING;
    }else{
        return NORMAL_ENDING;
    }
}
--- End Original ---

--- Transformed Code ---
#include <klee/klee.h>

/* 
 * Stub for log() function.
 * Since log() is monotonic for positive x, we can model it with 
 * a symbolic double constrained to match log(symvar) in the branch of interest.
 * Alternatively, for the specific branch, we can solve for symvar:
 *    1.94 < log(symvar) < 1.95  =>  exp(1.94) < symvar < exp(1.95)
 *    exp(1.94) ≈ 6.96, exp(1.95) ≈ 7.03, so symvar == 7
 * So, for the branch to be taken, symvar must be 7.
 * We replace log(symvar) with a branch on symvar.
 */

int symvar = s[0] - 48;
// Only allow symvar in the valid domain of log(), i.e., symvar > 0
klee_assume(symvar > 0);

double d;
/* Model log(symvar) for symvar > 0 */
if (symvar == 7) {
    d = 1.945; // any value in (1.94, 1.95)
} else {
    d = 0.0; // value outside (1.94, 1.95)
}

Your job:

1. **Behavioral equivalence.** Confirm that for *all inputs*, both versions yield identical observable behavior (return values, I/O, side‐effects).  
2. **Symbolic‐execution suitability.** Confirm that no rewrite step breaks KLEE‐friendliness (e.g. missing necessary `klee_assume`, unbounded loops, removed branches).

**Crucial rule for externals/stubs:**  
- If the transform *intentionally* stubbed an external or complex function (e.g. `calculate_bonus`), **do not** flag it as an issue *unless* you *know* of a *specific* missing constraint that’s required for correctness (e.g., “bonus must be ≤ 100” if you know that fact).  
- Otherwise, **silently accept** the stub.

Also:
- **Ignore** style, formatting, or unrelated refactorings.  
- **Only** report issues if you can give **actionable feedback** (e.g. “add `klee_assume(x>=0)` here”).

**Respond in this exact format:**

Reasoning:
<short bullet‐points describing any true, resolvable issues>

Decision: YES   # if you find no actionable issues  
Decision: NO    # if you have meaningful feedback

Feedback:
<If NO, list concise, actionable suggestions; if YES, leave blank.>
