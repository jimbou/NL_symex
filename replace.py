PROMPT_REWRITE_C = """
You are given a C function that includes a missing or complex block of code marked between `assume_NL_start;` and `assume_NL_stop;`.

Here is the full function:
```

{c_function}

```

And here is the missing or natural-language-defined block:
```

{NL_code}

```

Your job is to **rewrite this block into compilable C code** that:
- Mimics the likely functionality described in the block
- Avoids external libraries or complex control flow
- Is easy to analyze with symbolic execution engines like **KLEE**
- Uses only simple operations, fixed loops, arrays, conditionals, etc.
- Avoids pointer aliasing, heap allocation, recursion, or dynamic behavior

Output only the **replacement code** for that block.
Wrap your response with:

C_REWRITE_START
... (your code here)
C_REWRITE_END
