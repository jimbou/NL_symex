You are a C program transformation assistant. Your task is to help map symbolic inputs from a **transformed** C program (used with KLEE) back to the **original** C program, so that **the same execution path** is triggered.

This situation occurs because the transformed code simplifies or rewrites parts of the original code to make it KLEE-compatible. These changes may involve:
- Type conversions (e.g., `float` → `int`)
- Removing or replacing mathematical operations
- Simplifying expressions or control flow

---

## Your Input

You will be provided with:

1. The **original full C code**, which contains logic that has been transformed.
2. The **transformed code region**, replacing a part of the original (marked with `assume_NL_start` and `assume_NL_stop`).
3. One **example symbolic test case**  in the ktest format from running KLEE on the transformed version.

---

## Your Task

You must write a Python function that **reconstructs the expected input** for the original code, based on the test case for the transformed code.

In other words:

> Given that the transformed code removes or simplifies some computation, you must **re-apply those transformations in reverse** to recover the original input values.

This ensures the input will follow the **same execution path** in the original code.

### For example:

If the **original code** contains:

float x;
x = x + 356;
x = pow(x, 2);
if (x == 625)


And the **transformed code** simplifies it to:


int x;
if (x == 625)

Then a test case like `x = 625` (int) works for the transformed code. But to make it work in the original code, we need to **reverse the transformation**:

* Take `x = 625`
* `x = sqrt(625) = 25`
* `x = 25 - 356 = -331`

Then we convert `-331` to 4 bytes as a float.


## Output Requirements

You must return a Python function:

```python
def remap_testcase(inputs: dict[str, list[int]]) -> dict[str, list[int]]:
```

This function:

* Accepts a dictionary where each value is a list of bytes (from a `.ktest` file).
* Converts the relevant values (e.g., reconstruct floats, apply inverse math).
* Returns a new dictionary in the same format, containing remapped bytes.

Ensure:

* Byte size is preserved (e.g., 4-byte float → 4-byte float).
* Transformed expressions are **inverted** correctly (e.g., `x = pow(x+356, 2)` → `x = sqrt(x) - 356`)
* You **only modify inputs relevant to the transformed region**.

## Inputs

### Original Code:

```c
/*
TOY:
*/
#include <string.h> 
#include <math.h>
#include "utils.h"
#include "a_tester.h"

// {"s":{"length": 4}}
int logic_bomb(char* s) {
    int symvar = s[0] - 48;
    assume_Nl_start;
    double d = log(symvar); 
    assume_NL_stop;
    if(2 < d && d < 3){
        return BOMB_ENDING;
    }else{
        return NORMAL_ENDING;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
char s[5];
klee_make_symbolic(&s, sizeof(s), "s");
klee_assume(s[4]=='\0');
return logic_bomb(s);
}

```

---

### Transformed Region:

```c

klee_assume(symvar > 0);
// double d = log(symvar);
double d;
if (symvar == 7) {
d = 2.5; // any value in (2,3)
} else {
    d = 0.0; // value outside (2,3)
}
    
```

---

### Example Transformed Test Case:


ktest file : '<unknown>'
args       : ['logic_bombs/ln_ef_l2/updated2.bc']
num objects: 1
object 0: name: 's'
object 0: size: 5
object 0: data: b'7\xff\xff\xff\x00'
object 0: hex : 0x37ffffff00
object 0: text: 7....



---
Don't focus only on the example test case. Use it as a guide to understand how the transformation works, but apply the same logic to any input that would be used in the original code by reversing the difference between the original and transformed code.
The remapping function should be general enough to handle any input that would be used in the original code, not just the example provided.
## Your Output

Return only the Python function `remap_testcase(...)` as described above.
